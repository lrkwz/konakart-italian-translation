help.addressFormats             = These are the address formats that are defined for your online store. <br /><br />An address format describes the way addresses will appear in different parts of the system. You define all the address formats you want to use here and then specify which ones you want to use in specific parts of the system elsewhere (eg. each country has an address format defined).<br /><br />An address format has a full format and a summary format - you should define both for each address format you create.<br /><br />An address format is selected by clicking on it\, and then it may be edited or deleted.<br /><br />A new address format may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button\, defining the new address format in the edit fields at the bottom\, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
help.audit                      = In KonaKart\, audit data is saved whenever an API method is called. It can be configured individually for <b>deletes</b>\, <b>edits</b>\, <b>inserts</b> and <b>reads</b>. Also the level of auditing can be set to <b>summary</b> or <b>detailed</b>. When set to <b>detailed</b>\, where possible\, the object being deleted\, inserted or edited\, is serialized and saved within the audit data and can be viewed in the <b>Object(s) </b> field.<br /><br />This window allows you to view audit data. It allows you to search for data based on<ul><li>The name of the API method that was called.</li><li>The action (i.e. Insert\, Read\, Delete\, Edit)</li><li> The id of the object being edited\, deleted etc. Note that this value is not always available because the API method may allow you to read\, insert\, delete or edit multiple objects in one call.</li><li>The id of the user that made the method call.</li></ul>In order to perform a search\, you must enter the search criteria and then click the <b>Search</b> button. The returned data may be sorted by clicking on the column names. If a row of audit data also contains more detailed information about the object(s) that were deleted\, inserted or edited\, this information is shown in an <b>Object(s) </b> field for the currently selected row.
help.categories                 = A tree view of categories is shown on the left side of the window. A category is selected by clicking on it\, and then it may be edited or deleted. The <b>Invisible</b> attribute\, when set\, will make the category invisible within the application. It won't be displayed within the category tree.<br /><br />A new category may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button. The new category will become the child of the currently selected category.<br /><br />By clicking the <b>Move</b> button\, another tree view appears on the right hand side of the window. You may move a category to a new position by selecting on the left tree view\, the category that you want to move. Then on the right tree view you select the new parent for the category; and finally you must click the <b>Save</b> button below the right tree view. .<br /><br />The <b>Products</b> button opens a window displaying a list of products for the chosen category. <br /><br />The <b>Tag Groups</b> button opens a popup window where you can associate one or more tag groups to this category. Tag groups are containers for tags which can be associated to products in the product maintenance panel. If a category for example were named "Digital Cameras"\, the tag groups could be Megapixels\, Optical Zoom\, Battery type etc. When a customer selects a category in the eCommerce application\, the tag groups (and tags) related to that category can be displayed so that a customer can refine his search. Continuing with the previous example\, the customer could wish to only view cameras with 6 MPixel resolution and optical zoom of 8x.
help.configFiles                = These are the configuration files that are defined for your online store. <br /><br />To edit a file\, first select it\, then click the \"<b>Edit</b>\" button to edit it. <br /><br />To reload the list of files click the \"<b>Reload</b>\" button.<br /><br />Note that most of the parameters will not take effect until you restart KonaKart.<br /><br />If you wish to change the list of files that are shown in the list you have to edit the <b>konakart_config_files.xml</b> file which you will find under <b>webapps/konakartadmin/WEB-INF/classes</b>.  In the default installation on Windows that is:<b>C:\\Program Files\\KonaKart\\webapps\\konakartadmin\\WEB-INF\\classes\\konakart_config_files.xml</b>
help.configuration              = KonaKart is configured using the configuration variables present within this section of the Administration Application. The variables are stored within the <b>configuration</b> database table and may be edited from this window.<br /><br />Changes may take a few seconds to become active because the application cache needs to be reloaded\, and this happens on a scheduled basis at the frequency defined by the <b>Client config cache refresh check interval</b> configuration variable that can be edited by clicking the <b>Cache</b> sub-section of the <b>Configuration</b> menu.<br /><br />Most variables have float over text with a short description of their functionality.
help.countries                  = These are the countries that are defined for your online store. A country has a name and 2/3 letter ISO codes. It also has an address format associated with it\, which determines how addresses within the country are formatted.<br /><br />A country is selected by clicking on it\, and then it may be edited or deleted.<br /><br />A new country may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button\, defining the new country in the edit fields at the bottom\, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
help.coupons                    = A Coupon may be associated with a promotion so that the promotion only becomes active when a customer enters a valid coupon code during the checkout process. Coupons may be created\, edited and deleted. Each coupon has a <b>Name</b> and <b>Description</b> which may be used to identify it. The <b>Coupon Code</b> is the code that a customer will enter during checkout in order to activate the coupon. The number of times that a coupon can be used\, may be limited by setting the <b>Max Usage</b> attribute. A value of -1 is equivalent to unlimited use and is the default. <br /><br />Each coupon may be associated to zero or more promotions\, These associations are managed by clicking on the <b>Promotions</b> button at the bottom of the window. As promotions are added or removed from the coupon\, the button label updates to show the current number of promotions. <br /><br />Remember that in order to be able to enter a promotion code during the checkout process\, you must select <b>Configuration >> My Store</b> from the Admin App and set the <b>Display Coupon Entry Field</b> configuration variable.
help.couponsFromPromotions      = A Coupon may be associated with a promotion so that the promotion only becomes active when a customer enters a valid coupon code during the checkout process. Coupons may be created\, edited and deleted. Each coupon has a <b>Name</b> and <b>Description</b> which may be used to identify it. The <b>Coupon Code</b> is the code that a customer will enter during checkout in order to activate the coupon. The number of times that a coupon can be used\, may be limited by setting the <b>Max Usage</b> attribute. A value of -1 is equivalent to unlimited use and is the default. <br /><br />Remember that in order to be able to enter a promotion code during the checkout process\, you must select <b>Configuration >> My Store</b> from the Admin App and set the <b>Display Coupon Entry Field</b> configuration variable.
help.currencies                 = These are the currencies that are defined for your online store. A currency has a name and a code as well as other attributes that define how it is displayed.<br /><br />A currency is selected by clicking on it\, and then it may be edited or deleted. Note that the default currency may not be deleted.<br /><br />A new currency may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button\, defining the new currency in the edit fields at the bottom\, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
help.customerCommunications     = You can use this tool to send template based eMails to your customers. Emails may be sent to all of your customers or only those that have requested to receive a newsletter. They may also be sent to customers that have asked to be notified about any updates for a particular product and to customers belonging to a certain customer group. The steps to take are as follows :<ul><li>Enter the name of the Velocity template that you wish to use. Note that you must only type in the name and not the \"_lang.vm\" extension which will be added for you and depends on the setting of the default language. Ensure that the template file exists on your classpath. For Tomcat it should be placed in your WEB-INF/classes directory. An example template called <b>Newsletter_en.vm</b> is supplied in the standard KonaKart installation package which you can use for testing purposes.</li><li>Now you may enter text that will be merged with your template. Note that how the text is used\, depends on your particular template design. Your template may contain all of the information it needs within the template itself. The text may contain HTML tags.</li><li>Before sending the mail to your customers\, you may want to test it. In order to test it\, you can click on the link that appears below the template entry field. An eMail will be sent to the eMail address of the logged in user.</li><li>Once you are satisfied with the template and its contents you may send the eMail to your customers. To send the eMail to all customers you must click on the link in the <b>Email to all customers</b> section. To send the eMail to all customers that have requested to receive the newsletter\, you must click on the link in the <b>Newsletter</b> section. If you are sending out a product update eMail\, you must first select the product from the dialog box that opens up when you click on the link in the <b>Product Notifications</b> section. Once selected\, a new link appears that allows you to actually send the mails. Finally\, if you are sending an eMail to all customers belonging to a customer group (i.e. all wholesale customers)\, you must select the group from the drop list in order for a new link to appear which allows you to send the eMails.</li></ul> The number of concurrent threads used to send the eMails can be set in the <b>Configuration>>Email Options</b> section of the Admin App. A log is created (SendTemplateEmail.log) which contains all of the eMail addresses used. The log file is created in your defined log directory which can be set in the <b>Configuration>>Logging</b> section of the Admin App.
help.customerGroups             = These are the customer groups that are defined for your online store. You can define as many customer groups as you please. They are used to aggregate customers of a certain type. For example\, you may have retail and wholesale customers.<br /><br />You should define the name and description of the customer group in each language that you want to provide in the store. There are a number of optional custom fields that may be used for your own specific data. The Price Id is an integer in the range of 0 to 3 where 0 is the default value. It is used to define which product price the customers within the group will use. This enables you to show different prices to different groups of customers.<br /><br />A customer group is selected by clicking on it\, and then it may be edited or deleted.<br /><br />A new customer group may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button\, defining the new customer group in the edit fields at the bottom\, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
help.customers                  = You may search for a customer by entering the last name in the Search Panel and then clicking the Search button. The search is not case sensitive unless your database is configured to be non-case sensitive.  Wildcard configuration parameters control the precise searches of substrings (See <b>Configuration>>Admin App Configuration</b>) but with the default settings a wildcard is added before and after all search text which means that all <b>Smiths</b> will be returned if you enter <b>mith</b> as the Last Name. In a similar fashion you can search for a customer based on certain fields of his address (street\, city and postcode). <br /><br />You may also search for all customers belonging to a customer group\, for administrator users and for users that have been enabled or disabled. An administrator can define default values for the customer group and customer type droplists (see <b>Configuration>>Admin App Configuration</b>)\, and also whether these droplists are visible for a certain user using role-based security.  In KonaKart\, an administrator can also log into the application with the same credentials and so can be considered to be a user and a customer.<br /><br />The Address field may be customized through a template\, and even disabled completely. The template can be found under <b>Configuration>>Admin App Configuration</b> and valid template fields are:<ul><li>$streets = street address + suburb</li><li>$city</li><li>$postcode</li><li>$state</li><li>$country</li></ul>To disable the address field you must leave the template empty.<br /><br />Any displayed customers may be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Click the <b>Orders</b> button to view any orders that the customer may have submitted.<br /><br />Click the <b>Email</b> button to send an email to the customer.<br /><br />Click the <b>Login</b> button to log in to the KonaKart eCommerce application as the selected customer\, in a new browser window. The base url and the features of the new window can be configured under <b>Configuration>>Admin App Configuration</b>. The user must have edit privileges for the Customers panel in order for this button to be visible.<br /><br />Click the <b>Reset Password</b> button to reset a customer's password - an email will be sent to the customer containing the new password.
help.customPanel1               = Help text for custom panel 1. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel2               = Help text for custom panel 2. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel3               = Help text for custom panel 3. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel4               = Help text for custom panel 4. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel5               = Help text for custom panel 5. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel6               = Help text for custom panel 6. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel7               = Help text for custom panel 7. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel8               = Help text for custom panel 8. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel9               = Help text for custom panel 9. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.customPanel10              = Help text for custom panel 10. Substitute this with your own text in the file AdminHelpMessages.properties.
help.dataFeeds                  = <b>Data Feeds</b><br /><br />This section is for configuring your data feeds.   Currently you can only send your product details to Google Data\, but other feeds may be added in the future. <br /><br />To enable you to send your products to Google you must first obtain a Google account and a Google API key and enter the details below.<br /><br />To run the product feed update either choose the option on the Tools menu of the Admin App or check the KonaKart User Guide for instructions on how to run the product feed update from a job scheduler such as cron.<br /><br />If you disable Google Data Feeds here\, no data (inserts\, updates or deletes) will be sent to Google Base when you modify (insert\, update or delete) products in KonaKart. Conversely\, if you enable Google Data Feeds\, KonaKart will update the published data in Google when product data is changed within KonaKart\, using the credentials you define on this configuration panel.
help.deleteSessions             = Every time a user logs on\, a session is created for the user\, and is persisted in the database. Sessions expire when a user logs off or after a certain amount of inactive time. <br /><br />Removing the expired sessions from the database\, improves performance since the session is checked every time the user decides to perform an action\, and a table with fewer sessions gives a faster response time.
help.editCustomerAddress        = This is the Customer's Default Address.<br />A drop list of zones is only displayed if the selected country actually has any associated zones. If the country has no associated zones\, then a <b><br />State</b> entry field is displayed which will accept any text value.<br />The <b>Custom Address</b> fields are generic fields that are associated with the address.   You can use these for whatever you like.
help.editCustomerPersonalCustom = These are the <b>Customer Custom</b> fields that relate to the Customer.<br /> You can use these for whatever you like.
help.editCustomerPersonalEdit   = Enter the personal details for the Customer.<br /><br />You cannot change the password here. Instead use the \"Reset Password\" on the Customers panel.<br /><br />The <b>Customer Type</b> may take one of three values:<ol><li>An Administrator User</li><li>A Standard Application Customer</li><li>A Default Customer. There should only be one of these. It is a fictitious customer used to create a temporary order for displaying order totals before the checkout process. i.e. In the edit cart screen a customer can see estimated shipping costs and promotional discounts without having to log in or register. The address of the default customer should be an address that will generate average shipping costs. i.e. If the majority of your business is national then it shouldn't be an international address.</li></ol><br/>If the <b>Customer Group</b> is changed to a valid new group\, you will be prompted to send a template based eMail to the customer. This is a useful feature for when the customer is going through an approval process. For example\, a customer may have registered through the application as a wholesale customer. During registration he was placed in a \"Waiting for Approval\" customer group and now the administrator may approve or decline the request. As a result of the approval\, the customer may receive an eMail informing him of the decision. The template used is in the form <b>CustGroupChange_groupId_lang.vm</b> e.g. CustGroupChange_2_en.vm\, if the customer has been moved to the group with id equals 2 in a system where the lang is \"en\".
help.editCustomerPersonalInsert = Enter the personal details for the Customer.<br /><br />The password field will display dots instead of the characters that you type.<br /><br />The <b>Customer Type</b> may take one of three values:<ol><li>An Administrator User</li><li>A Standard Application Customer</li><li>A Default Customer. There should only be one of these. It is a fictitious customer used to create a temporary order for displaying order totals before the checkout process. i.e. In the edit cart screen a customer can see estimated shipping costs and promotional discounts without having to log in or register. The address of the default customer should be an address that will generate average shipping costs. i.e. If the majority of your business is national then it shouldn't be an international address.</li></ol>
help.editOrder                  = This panel may be used to edit various details of an order.<br /><br />The state of the order may be changed by selecting the new state from a drop list of available states. The new state information and any associated comments are also added to the audit trail of the order. If the <b>Notify Customer</b> check box is clicked\, an email is automatically sent to the customer to inform him that the state of his order has changed.<br /><br />If the panel has been configured to show credit card details\, then these may be edited and saved. Note that they will be automatically encrypted before being saved in the database.<br /><br />If the panel has been configured to display the order number\, tracking number and custom fields\, then these may be edited and saved. Note that the <b>Order Number</b> is a user specific order number that may be set when the order is saved. This differs from the Order Id which is a unique integer automatically assigned by the KonaKart engine when the order is saved.
help.editProductsAttributes     = Attributes may be added to the product by selecting them from the list box (multiple selections are allowed) and then clicking the arrowed button to create the attribute details on the right hand side of the window.<br /><br />For each attribute you must enter a numeric value which will be added or subtracted from the price of the product if the customer selects this option. You may enter optional values <b>P1 to P3</b> which will be used if the customer is using product <b>Price1 to Price3</b>. For example if your store supports both retail and wholesale customers which are differentiated by the customer group that they belong to\, you will probably be displaying different prices to them. In this case\, if a product has options\, the option prices can also be differentiated.
help.editProductsCategories     = A product may reside in one or more categories. The actual details of the product only exist once in the database since the same product instance may be linked to multiple categories.<br /><br />At least one category must be selected.<br /><br />A warning image ( <img src='warning.gif'> ) after the category name means that it is an invisible category and so is not visible within the application category tree. 
help.editProductsDetails        = The <b>quantity</b> and <b>SKU</b> fields should only be used if this product has a single quantity and a single SKU. If the product has multiple quantities for different configurations\, then the quantities and SKU's should be entered in the Quantities tab. In this tab the quantity field should be set to 0 and the SKU field left empty.<br /><br /><b>Price1 to Price3</b> are optional price fields that can be used for saving other prices such as wholesale price or MRP. User groups may be configured to use one of these alternative prices\, so that you can differentiate the prices that you users see based on the group that they belong to. <br /><br /><b>Invisible products</b> are never returned by the KonaKart server API and therefore are never shown in the shopping application (your store). Invisible products are still available for ordering via the API\, so can be useful in certain circumstances\, however in most cases products will not be made invisible - which is the default.  You can configure the Admin App to either show the invisible products in the Admin App (the default) or not show them (see the Configuration section).<br /><br />When a product type of <b>Bundled Product</b> is selected\, some extra buttons appear on the UI:<ul><li><b>Select Products</b> opens up a pop-up window to enable the selection of products to include in the bundle. When this pop-up window is closed\, the selected products are not saved in the database until the save button on this window is clicked. </li><li><b>Calc Price</b> sets the price fields of the bundle product by adding the prices of the products in the bundle. A discount can be entered into the calculation by typing a number in the Discount field next to the Calc Price button. The discount number will be treated as a percentage if the % character is entered after the number. (e.g 10% rather than 10). The calculated prices can be overridden at any time and are not saved in the database until the Save button is clicked.</li><li><b>Calc Weight</b> sets the Weight field of the bundle product by adding the weights of the products in the bundle. The calculated weight can be overridden at any time and is not saved in the database until the Save button is clicked.</li></ul> The <b>Quantity</b> field for a bundle product is read-only. It is calculated by considering the quantities of all components of the bundle and the lowest quantity is returned. If the quantity of a product within the bundle is greater than 1 then this information is also used within the formula.<br /><br />The <b>Stock Reorder Level</b> defaults to -1 which means that the global value defined by the STOCK_REORDER_LEVEL configuration variable is used. If set to a positive number\, then this value will override the global value.<br /><br /><b>Can order when not in stock</b> defaults to the global value defined by the STOCK_ALLOW_CHECKOUT configuration variable. The default value can be overridden on a product by product basis\, by setting it to yes or no.
help.editProductsCustom         = Define whatever you like to be in the custom attribute fields. The field labels can be changed through the message catalog.
help.editProductsDescription    = A product name and description must be entered for each language. The product URL and the Product Comparison Data are not compulsory.<br /><br />The Product Comparison Data is structured data that can be used on the UI to compare this product with a similar product. For example\, it could be XML where each tag represents a feature of the product. <br /><br /><b>Note:</b> The Insert or Save button will not be enabled until valid data has been entered in all compulsory fields (colored yellow) in <b>all tabs</b>. If you are wondering why the Insert or Save button isn't enabled\, you should cycle through all of the tabs colored yellow and look for entry fields colored yellow.
help.editProductsDownloads      = The <b>File Path</b> and <b>Content Type</b> are used for Digital Download products. The File Path is the path of a file containing the digital product. This path will be appended to the <b>Base Path</b> defined by a configuration variable. Therefore for example\, the Base Path could be \"C:/images/\" and the file path could be \"cities/london.jpg\". Note that if the Base Path ends with a \"/\" then the file path should not start with a \"/\" because the two strings are concatenated to create the full path for the digital product. The Content Type describes the content of the file. Examples are \"image/jpeg\" or \"application/pdf\".<br /><br />The <b>Max Download Days</b> attribute defines the maximum number of days the product can be downloaded for. It defaults to -1 which means that the global value defined by the DD_MAX_DOWNLOAD_DAYS configuration variable is used. If set to a positive number\, then this value will override the global value.<br /><br />The <b>Max Number Downloads</b> attribute defines the maximum number of times which the product can be downloaded. It defaults to -1 which means that the global value defined by the DD_MAX_DOWNLOADS configuration variable is used. If set to a positive number\, then this value will override the global value.
help.editProductsImages         = This tool allows you to upload images to the server from the local file system and to edit the product image attributes in order to point to an image.<br /><br /><b>Image Upload</b><br />Image base URL and Image base path are configuration variables and can be managed in the configuration section of this application. The Image base URL is used to view the images on this window and so you will only be able to see the images if this value is set correctly. The Image base Path is the base path on the file system of the server where images will be uploaded. Image Path is the path relative to the base path where images will be uploaded. In order to upload an image you must select one on your local file system using the browse button\, and then click the upload button. The image will be uploaded and the full path of the image will become Image base Path + Image Path + Image Name. The image name will automatically be set to the name of the image on the file system. However\, it can be changed before clicking the upload button in order to save the image on the server with a different name. Note that the image path does not require start or ending file separators.<br /><br /><b>Product Image Attributes</b><br />The product has 4 unique image attributes which can be used by the UI for displaying images of the product (i.e. thumbnail\, large image\, small image etc.). In order to set the image attributes of the product\, you must type in the image path + name (relative to the base path) and click the Save button. If the image exists and if the Image base URL is set correctly\, you should see a thumbnail of the image alongside the attribute entry field.
help.editProductsMerchandising  = Products may be associated with other products so that when selected\, the application displays the associated products to attempt to convince the customer to buy an accessory or a more expensive but similar product or an extended warranty etc.KonaKart aupports the following types of mechandising:<ul><li><b>Up-selling</b> is a sales technique whereby a salesman attempts to have the consumer purchase more expensive items\, upgrades\, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. Up-selling usually involves marketing more profitable services or products\, but up-selling can also be simply exposing the customer to other options he or she may not have considered previously.</li><li><b>Cross-selling</b> is the strategy of selling other products to a customer who has already purchased (or signaled their intention to purchase) a product from the vendor. For example\, you could show more books from the same author.</li><li><b>Accessories</b> for a product can be displayed in order to persuade the customer to purchase them while purchasing the main product. For example you could show a range of notebook cases when a customer is buying a notebook PC.</li><li><b>Dependent Products</b> are products which need to be sold together with the main product. They normally consist of service plans or extended warranties.</li></ul><br />In order to associate some products to the main product\, you must follow these steps:<ul><li>Select the merchandising type from the drop list</li><li>Search for the products by typing a search string and clicking the <b>Search</b> button</li><li>Add one or more products by selecting them on the left panel and then by clicking the <b>>></b> button to add them to the right panel</li><li>Any unwanted products may be removed from the right panel by selecting them and clicking the <b>Del</b> button</li><li>When you are happy with the selection\, you must click the <b>Save</b> button to write the changes to the database. Note that the <b>Save</b> button must be clicked before moving onto another merchandising type.</li></ul>
help.editProductsQuantities     = This screen is used when you need to assign different quantities to a product based on its attributes. For example if you have a shirt that comes in various colors and sizes\, you will probably want to know how many you have in stock for the various color / size combinations.<br /><br />If the product has no attributes\, then this screen has no purpose. If the product does have attributes\, you can set the quantity in stock\, the SKU and available date for each combination by using the <b>quantity</b>\,  <b>SKU</b> and <b>Date Available</b> fields on each row of the table. If any of the rows is set to a number other than zero\, then the product quantity attribute (in the details tab) is ignored. If all rows are set to zero\, then the value in the product quantity attribute is used. Therefore\, in order to guarantee accurate results\, the product quantity attribute should be set to zero when you intend using this feature.<br /><br />When inserting a product this screen will be empty because it can only display data based on product attributes that already exist. You must save the product\, click the <b>Back</b> button and then edit the product in order to insert SKU / quantity / date available data.
help.editProductsReviews        = Reviews may be edited and deleted by clicking on the Edit and Delete links for each review.
help.editProductsSpecial        = If a special price is entered\, then this price will become the new special price of the product. In order to remove the special price\, it just has to be removed from the input field.<br /><br />If an expiry date is selected\, the special price will expire when this date is reached. 
help.editProductsStores         = This panel can be used to assign products to multiple stores. The price Id may be different for each store so that the product can pick up a different price based on the store.<br /><br />In insert mode\, the panel will be empty and during the insert\, the product will be automatically assigned to the current store.<br /><br />In edit mode\, the list box on the left will display a list of all available stores. In order to associate a product to a store\, one or more stores must be selected in the list box before clicking the <b>\>\></b> button which will create the association. Note that the default price Id is set to -1 which means that the standard product price will be used (which may be determined by the customer group). If the price Id is set to 0-3\, then price 0 to price 3 are used\, regardless of the customer group.<br /><br />Note that if a product is removed from the current store\, then it will no longer be visible after clicking the save button. Note also that after assigning a product to a store\, you must log into that store using this application and assign the product to one or more categories before it will be visible in the store front application.<br /><br />This panel is only available to Super Users. 
help.editProductsTags           = This panel allows you to associate tags to products. Tags may be used in the eCommerce application to filter product searches. All tags belong to one or more tag groups and tag groups may be associated to categories so that the application can determine which tag groups to display based on the current product category being displayed. For example\, for a tag group named Megapixels within a category named Digital Cameras\, the tags could be 4 Mpixel\, 6 MPixel\, 8 Mpixel etc. <br /><br />The tag groups displayed in the left panel are the tag groups associated to the category or categories of this product. The product must have been saved in order for the left panel to be populated. When a tag group is clicked on\, the tags within the group become visible and may be associated to the product by clicking the <b>>></b> button. To remove tags\, you must click on them on the right panel and then click the <b>Del</b> button. Multiple selection is allowed for removes.
help.editStore                  = This panel allows you to edit an existing store.<br /><br />Once the storeId is set for a store it cannot be changed but the name and description can be changed at any time.<br /><br />The store status settings are defined as follows:<br /><br /><b>Enabled</b> = active stores that are available for use.  If disabled a store is not accessible to application or admin app users. <br /><br /><b>Under Maintenance</b> = stores that are currently being maintained so are inaccessible to application users, but can be accessed by admin app users.<br /><br /><b>Deleted</b> = stores that are deleted are no longer available for use by application or admin app users.  These stores are not physically deleted from the database but only marked as "deleted".  Therefore it is possible to "Un-delete" a store if required. 
help.insertStore                = This panel allows you to insert a new store.<br /><br />You specify the storeId here but you cannot change this after your save the store the first time.  The storeId you choose must be unique - the system will not let you insert a new store with a storeId that's already being used.<br /><br />The name and description can be changed at any time.<br /><br />The store status settings are defined as follows:<br /><br /><b>Enabled</b> = active stores that are available for use.  If disabled a store is not accessible to application or admin app users. <br /><br /><b>Under Maintenance</b> = stores that are currently being maintained so are inaccessible to application users, but can be accessed by admin app users.<br /><br /><b>Deleted</b> = stores that are deleted are no longer available for use by application or admin app users.  These stores are not physically deleted from the database but only marked as "deleted".  Therefore it is possible to "Un-delete" a store if required.  
help.ipnHistory                 = This window allows you to view and search for notifications sent to KonaKart by payment gateways. Many payment gateways can be configured to send transaction information to KonaKart regarding the status of the payment\, and this information is stored in a database for auditing purposes.
help.languages                  = These are the languages that are defined for your online store. A language has a name and a code.<br /><br />A language is selected by clicking on it\, and then it may be edited or deleted. Note that the default language may not be deleted.<br /><br />A new language may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button\, defining the new language in the edit fields at the bottom\, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
help.logging                    = <b>Logging</b><br /><br />Logging is typically only used for diagnostic purposes and recommended to be set off <b>OFF</b> for normal use. <br /><br />To see diagnostic logging from the KonaKart Admin App you need to set the <b>Admin App logging level</b> to a level higher than <b>OFF</b> (for example set it to \"INFO\") and ensure that the <b>log4j.logger.com.konakart.clientlogging</b> value in <b>konakartadmin/WEB-INF/classes/konakart-logging.properties</b> is set to the same level (or higher) (for example set it to \"INFO\" or \"DEBUG\").  <br /><br />You can edit that <b>konakart-logging.properties</b> file from the <b>Edit Config Files</b> configuration menu option.<br /><br />The KonaKart log file directory is the location where certain KonaKart diagnostic log files are written eg. payment gateway response log files\, velocity results files etc.  This is also for diagnostics only and no log files are written unless other debug flags are set elsewhere. <br /><br /><b>Analytics</b><br /><br />Enabling Analytics causes some code (that is defined in the Messages.properties file\, as key <b>analytics.code</b>) to be inserted into your store's web pages.  The intended use for this feature is to insert analytics code (for example Google Analytics Code) into your store so that you can obtain useful statistics on the use of your site.
help.manufacturers              = All manufacturers within the database are shown in the list box in alphabetical order. <br /><br />Each manufacturer may be edited or deleted. If you choose to delete a manufacturer that has products linked to it in the database\, you will be presented with the option of allowing the system to delete the products also.<br /><br />A new manufacturer may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button.<br /><br />The <b>Products</b> button opens a window displaying a list of products for the chosen manufacturer.
help.modules                    = This tool allows you to install and uninstall payment modules\, shipping modules and order total modules.<br /><br />The installation process consists of writing configuration data into the database configuration table. Once the installation process for a module is complete\, the tool also allows you to edit the data so that the default values can be changed. During run-time\, the KonaKart application reads the configuration data to determine which modules to activate and how to configure them.<br /><br />The removal process\, removes all of the configuration data from the database.<br /><br />When a module is installed and enabled\, it will be visible and selectable during the checkout process. Most modules can be disabled without having to uninstall them.<br /><br />Changes may take a few seconds to become active because the application cache needs to be reloaded\, and this happens on a scheduled basis at the frequency defined by the <b>CLIENT_CONFIG_CACHE_CHECK_SECS</b> configuration variable.
help.multistoreConfig           = <b>Multi-Store Configuration</b><br /><br />These are the configuration variables that are used in a multi-store installation.<br /><br />You can define the multi-store template storeId to the store whose reports you wish to copy for new stores (in the future\, more configuration data may be copied from the template store).<br /><br />You can define the roles that will be assigned to new users that are created when you create new stores.  The number of new users that are created when creating new stores is dependent on whether you are using Shared or Non-Shared Customers.  In Shared Customers mode\, only a "Store Administrator" user is created, but in Non-Shared Customers mode a "Super User" user is also created.  You can change the roles that are assigned for the users and change the roles themselves to configure the permissions granted to new users exactly as you please.<br /><br />When new stores are created some SQL commands are run to set up the database in various ways.  First the "KonaKart new store creation SQL" script is run\, then KonaKart loads some set-up data that isn't in any SQL script\, then finally this is followed by the execution of the "User new store creation SQL" script.  If you need to change the data that is loaded\, you should add your SQL commands to the "User new store creation SQL" script and not modify the "KonaKart" script.<br /><br />For more specialized requirements there is a "hook" function that is called whenever a store is created or modified.   You have to implement this class in java (default name is <b>com.konakartadmin.bl.AdminStoreIntegrationMgr</b>) and it will be executed by KonaKart at the appropriate times (See the User Guide for details of this customization opportunity).
help.orderStatus                = These are the order statuses that are defined for your online store. <br /><br />You can define as many order status names as you please. Order statuses describe the status of orders in the system.<br /><br />An order status has a name (and an id that's not shown).  You should define the name in each language that you want to provide in the store.<br /><br />An order status is selected by clicking on it\, and then it may be edited or deleted.<br /><br />A new order status may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button\, defining the new order status in the edit fields at the bottom\, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
help.orders                     = This panel can be configured to display the Order Id or the Order Number in the left most column. The Order Id is generated by KonaKart automatically and is a unique ascending integer. The Order Number may be generated by custom business logic just before an order is saved and so may adhere to company standards etc. The Order Number may contain both letters and numbers. The panel can be configured in the <b>Configuration>>Admin App Configuration</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br />You may search for orders using a combination of various filters:<br /><br /><ul><li>Orders from a certain customer</li><li>Orders based on their Order Id or Order Number</li><li>Orders in a certain state</li></ul>Once the search criteria have been set\, you must click the search button.<br /><br />Any displayed orders may be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Click the <b>Invoice</b> button to view and print the invoice.<br /><br />Click the <b>Packing Slip</b> button to view and print the packing slip.<br /><br />Click the <b>Payment Info</b> button to view any payment gateway information that may be associated with the order. .<br /><br />Click the <b>Returns</b> button to view / edit / insert any information regarding products that have been returned.<br /><br />Click the <b>Customer</b> button to go to a panel showing information about the customer that submitted the order. From this panel you can send an eMail to the customer\, log in to the application as the customer etc.
help.productOptions             = A list of product options is shown on the left side of the window. The available values for each option can be viewed by clicking the <b>+</b> symbol next to the option name. Each option or option value may be edited or deleted\, by selecting it and clicking the appropriate button.<br /><br />To create a new option\, you must select the <b>root</b> node and then click the <b>New</b> button. To create a new option value\, you must select the option\, and then click the <b>New</b> button.
help.productAvailableDate       = This panel is intended for a power user to quickly update the available date of a product based on its SKU.<br/><br/> The intended way of using the panel is to enter the SKU and then to tab into the Date field. At this point the SKU will be looked up and if it is valid\, the product name will appear below the SKU field and the current available date will appear below the Date field. If the SKU is invalid\, then the color of the SKU field will remain yellow. Once a valid date has been entered\, the Save button will activate and so you can tab to it and press the enter key to save the data. At this point\, the focus will be returned to the SKU field and a line will be written to the log area to confirm that the transaction was successful.<br/><br/>The check box below the save button\, allows you to decide whether you want the date field to be cleared after the save button is clicked. If you have multiple SKUs with the same date\, it is convenient not to clear the field. The date template below the check box\, allows you to change the date template for entering the date. For example you may want to enter just two numbers for the year rather than four.<br/><br/>The log area may be cleared by clicking the clear button below the log.
help.productQuantity            = This panel is intended for a power user to quickly update the quantity of a product based on its SKU.<br/><br/> The intended way of using the panel is to enter the SKU and then to tab into the Quantity field. At this point the SKU will be looked up and if it is valid\, the product name will appear below the SKU field and the current quantity will appear below the Quantity field. If the SKU is invalid\, then the color of the SKU field will remain yellow. Once a valid quantity has been entered\, the Save button will activate and so you can tab to it and press the enter key to save the data. At this point\, the focus will be returned to the SKU field and a line will be written to the log area to confirm that the transaction was successful.<br/><br/>The check box below the save button\, allows you to decide whether you want the new quantity to be added to the existing quantity or whether you want it to replace the existing quantity.<br/><br/>The log area may be cleared by clicking the clear button below the log.
help.products                   = You may search for products using a combination of various filters:<br /><br /><ul><li>Products containing some text</li><li>Products by SKU</li><li>Products within a category</li><li>Products of a manufacturer</li><li>Products of a certain type</li><li>Products coming soon</li><li>Products on special offer</li></ul>Wildcard configuration parameters control the precise searches of substrings (See <b>Configuration>>Admin App Configuration</b>) but with the default settings a wildcard is added before and after all search text which means that all <b>Apples</b> will be returned if you enter <b>ple</b> as the search string.<br /><br />To search by SKU\, you must check the SKU check box and enter the SKU in the text field above the search button. If the SKU check box isn't checked\, the search is done on the product name and description. Once the search criteria have been set\, you must click the search button.<br /><br />Any displayed product may be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the list. Click the <b>New</b> button to create a product.

The rules available allow you to exclude or include a number of Manufacturers\, Categories\, Products\, Customers and Customers belonging to specific Customer Groups\, from a promotion\, by clicking on the links.<br /><br />The popup window that opens\, allows you to make a selection. When you close the popup window\, this window gives you a summary of the actions that the rules will take. i.e. How many products will be included or how many customers will be excluded etc.
help.promotions                 = A promotion is an offer that a merchant may apply to any number of his products. Promotions may be created\, edited and deleted. Once a promotion has been created\, clicking the <b>Rules</b> button allows you to refine it by:<ul><li>Allowing only certain customers to use the promotion</li><li>Allowing all customers to use the promotion except for some</li><li>Including only certain products with particular options in the promotion</li><li>Including all products in the promotion except for some</li><li>Including only products from certain categories in the promotion</li><li>Including products from all categories in the promotion except for some</li><li>Including only products from certain manufacturers in the promotion</li><li>Including products from all manufacturers in the promotion except for some</li></ul><br /><b>New</b><br />When the new button is clicked\, some edit fields become visible. These edit fields apply to all promotions. The ones in yellow are mandatory and must be set with valid data. The promotion must be given a name and the type of promotion must be selected from the drop list. Once a type has been selected\, more edit fields appear which are specific to the selected promotion. They must all be set and then the promotion can be saved.<br /><br />The promotion types available in the drop list are defined in the <b>Modules>>Order Total</b> section of the Admin App. New types may be added by adding new modules to KonaKart. Note that the promotion will not become active until the relevent OrderTotal module has been installed.<br /><br /><b>Coupons</b><br />A promotion may be associated with one or more coupons. This means that during the checkout process\, the customer must enter a valid coupon code in order to activate the promotion. The window that opens by clicking this button\, allows you to manage <b>only</b> the coupons associated with this promotion.<br /><br /><b>Rules</b><br />This button opens a window that allows you to add rules to the promotion in order to narrow down the number of products and customers that it applies to.
help.protocol                   = <b>HTTP / HTTPS</b><br /><br />KonaKart is configured using the configuration variables present within this section of the Administration Application. The variables are stored within the <b>configuration</b> database table and may be edited from this window.<br /><br />Changes may take a few seconds to become active because the application cache needs to be reloaded\, and this happens on a scheduled basis at the frequency defined by the <b>Client config cache refresh check interval</b> configuration variable that can be edited by clicking the <b>Cache</b> sub-section of the <b>Configuration</b> menu.<br /><br />Most variables have float over text with a short description of their functionality.<br /><br />On this panel you can enable or disable the use of SSL and define related parameters.<br /><br />There are two ways to define the use of SSL on this panel.  One is to define the <b>port numbers</b> for HTTP mode and HTTPS mode respectively.  From these port values the secure redirect URL is derived.   The other choice is to define the <b>Base URL</b> for your SSL pages which overrides the standard derivation of the redirect URL and does not use the SSL port number definition.  For the <b>Base URL</b> you should use a string that defines what your requests should be from the outside before the request URI is appended to the end. If you use the standard SSL port you can remove that from the base URL definition.
help.publishProducts            = Click the <b>Publish</b> button to start a background process that will publish details of all your visible and active products to Google.<br /><br />This process uses the values configured on the <b>Data Feeds</b> Configuration panel.<br /><br />Check your publish products log in your logs directory and the container log for details of the success or failure of the publishing process.
help.refreshConfig              = The configuration variables used to configure KonaKart\, are stored in the database and can be edited in the Configuration section of this admin tool. <br /><br />For performance reasons\, these properties are cached. This means that changes made to the properties in the database are not seen by KonaKart until the cache is refreshed. This functionality allows you to make many modifications to the configuration variables in the database\, and to activate them all at once by refreshing the cache.
help.reports                    = These are the reports that are defined for your online store. <br /><br />To add a new report click the \"<b>New</b>\" button and then you specify the filename of the new report to upload.<br /><br />To edit a report\, first select it\, then click the \"<b>Edit</b>\" button to edit it - although you may find it easier to experiment with writing new reports in the Eclipse environment using the BIRT plugins.<br /><br />To delete a report\, first select it\, then click the \"<b>Delete</b>\" button to delete it.  You are asked to confirm the deletion before the report is actually deleted.<br /><br />To run a report\, first select it\, then click the \"<b>Run</b>\" button to execute it.
help.returns                    = An order may have multiple returns (i.e. The products within the order may be returned at different times). The return must contain a Return Merchandise Authorization code (RMA) and may contain text explaining the reason for the return. Each return contains a number of returned products whose quantity cannot exceed the total number of products within the order.<br /><br /><b>Searching and Editing</b><br />Returns may be searched for by the id of the order or by the RMA. You must enter either or both codes and then click the <b>Search</b> button. This will retrieve all return objects matching the search criteria. In most cases there will only be one return per order. When you click on a row containing a return\, the details of the return will be displayed. The details include the Order Id\, the RMA Code and the Return Reason. Below these details\, you will see a list of products that the order contained. Each product can be identified by its product Id and / or its SKU.

You may notice that there are some other check boxes labelled <b>Cust1</b>\, <b>Cust2</b> and <b>Cust3</b>. These may be used by a panel to configure access to features such as pop-up windows for that panel. If they are being used\, they will be in green and float-over text will explain what they are being used for.<br /><br />A new role may be entered by clicking the <b>New</b> button and then by filling the required fields in the popup window. Existing roles may be edited or deleted by selecting them and then clicking the <b>Edit</b> or <b>Delete</b> buttons. Each role has a name and description\, which are compulsory fields. There are five custom fields and a SuperUser check box. When SuperUser is set\, the role allows an administrator to administer a store even when it has been deleted or is disabled.<br /><br />KonaKart can be configured for API Call security in the <b>Security and Auditing</b> section of the <b>Configuration</b> menu. This provides an extra level of security by defining the API Calls that can be accessed by any particular role. When enabled\, a <b>Show API Calls</b> button will appear\, that allows you to switch between panel and API Calls. The configuration of API Calls works in a similar fashion to the panel based security explained above. You can add API Calls to the role by selecting them in the <b>Available API Calls</b> list and then clicking the <b>Add</b> button. You can remove API Calls from the role by selecting them in the <b>Assigned API Calls</b> list and then clicking the <b>Remove button</b> button. Note that multiple selects are allowed.
